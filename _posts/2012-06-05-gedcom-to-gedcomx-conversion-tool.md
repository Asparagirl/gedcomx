Having made the decision to go with a [zip-based file format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md)
for GEDCOM X ([thanks for your feedback, by the way](http://familysearch.github.com/gedcomx//2012/06/05/thanks-for-feedback.html)),
we thought that what was _really needed_ was a way for everybody to convert a GEDCOM 5.5 file
to a GEDCOM X file.

Well, we're happy to announce that [we've got one for you to use now](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-conversion).
Check it out. Push through some of your own GEDCOM files. Let us know what's
broken by [opening up an issue](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcom5-conversion/issues).

Enjoy!
