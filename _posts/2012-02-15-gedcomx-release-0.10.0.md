It's been a wild two weeks since RootsTech 2012. We've already received a lot of great feedback
at the [Github project](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx). So much so, in fact, that we're 
scrambling to provide enough resources to address all the issues in a timely manner. We thank you 
for your patience as we work out all the kinks in the process.

We also anticipate using these posts to encourage those of you who are still unsure how to 
participate in the process. Future posts could include quick polls or surveys and an overview of the
hottest issues of the moment.

For today, we're just announcing the release of GEDCOM X 0.10.0. Nothing too big. We've taken a stab
at the standard definition of the [search results resource](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/pull/128)
so that we can do searching in a standard way across all the applications that conform to the
standard [application profile](http://10.72.13.90/gedcomx/Application-Profiles.html). And there were
[a handful of other](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/issues?milestone=8&state=closed) minor issues 
that got addressed.
