GEDCOM X 0.4.0 has been released.

The primary feature of this release is [RDF Integration](http://www.gedcomx.org/RDF-Integration.html), which resulted in some
significant improvements and smoothing of some rough edges. For a list of issues that were addressed (along with their 
conversation threads), see [the list of 0.4.0 issues](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/issues?state=closed&milestone=2).

Enjoy!
