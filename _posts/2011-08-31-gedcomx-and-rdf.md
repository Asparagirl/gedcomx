A lot of work has been done recently to define GEDCOM X in terms of an [RDF Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/) 
by specifying an [RDF Schema](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/) document that defines each of the core GEDCOM X namespaces.
By providing support for RDF, GEDCOM X gains some notable benefits, including:

* assurance of conformance to industry-accepted standards
* a standard way to reference and describe resources
* compatibility with known standards for describing physical and digital artifacts via [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/)
* compatibility with known standards for describing users and organizations via [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/)
* a standard way to embed (genealogical) data into web pages through [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-in-html/)
* automatic compliance with powerful tools built to analyze the [semantic web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web)

The details of RDF integration are detailed in the [RDF Integration](http://www.gedcomx.org/RDF-Integration.html) document.

Enjoy!
