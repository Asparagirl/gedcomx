Ever have a question like the following?

> How does GEDCOM X handle &lt;insert-special-case-here&gt;?

Introducing the [GEDCOM X Recipe Book](http://www.gedcomx.org/Recipe-Book.html).

A _recipe_ intends to address a specific question about how the GEDCOM X 
model is to be used in a specific use case. For each use case, there could be multiple, 
equally valid ways to address the requirements and the recipe book intends to facilitate
interoperability by officially recommending a specific use of the model.

Want to request that a new recipe be added? Awesome.
